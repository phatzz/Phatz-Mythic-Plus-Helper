# Phatz-Simple-Explosive-Killer
A simple plugin to kill explosives on mouseover/target.
Lots of code taken from AYA's kick plugin, hence the delay settings.
I only play Paladin so other classes are untested.
I can add any spell on request, just send me the spellname and the range of the spell.
Works best with ranged, spammable spells with no cooldowns that don't interfere with your damage rotation.


Possible future ToDo (not likely to be soon.)
- Add support for using more than 1 spell.
- Add support for stun/slow Spiteful Shade on Spiteful Affix.
