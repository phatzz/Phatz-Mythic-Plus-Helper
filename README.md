<details>
<Summary>Usage</summary>
<li>Works best with ranged, spammable spells with no cooldowns that don't interfere with your damage rotation. Moonfire and Frost Shock are perfect spells for this.
<li>If the spell has a 6second cooldown you can (obviously) only kill explosives every 6 seconds, for example.

<li>Recommend using mouseover to control what explosive to kill and not to interfere with your main damage rotation. 
<li>I can not guarantee which spell aimsharp will cast if you directly target the explosive. 
<li>The plugin has logic for casting spell on targeted explosive - but no logic for pausing main rotation, effects uncertain and may vary.

<Summary>To do list</Summary>
