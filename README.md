<Summary>Usage</summary>
Works best with ranged, spammable spells with no cooldowns that don't interfere with your damage rotation.
If your spell has a 6second cooldown you can (obviously) only kill explosives every 6 seconds, for example.

Recommend using mouseover to control what explosive to kill and not to interfere with your main damage rotation. I can not guarantee which spell aimsharp will cast if you directly target the explosive. The plugin has logic for casting spell on targeted explosive - but no logic for pausing main rotation, effects uncertain and may vary.

<Summary>Information</summary>
Lots of code borrowed from Aya's kick plugin, thanks to Aya and Snoogen for keeping their plugins opensource.
I mostly play Paladin at the moment so most spells are untested but please give feedback.
I can add any spell on request, just send me the spellname and the range of the spell.

 <Summary>Possible future ToDo</Summary>
Consider making spell text like in Snoogens queue plugin instead of dropdown.
Add support for using more than 1 spell on explosives.
Advanced logic per class instead of working per spell, for example using different spells depending on the range to the explosive for melee classes and use spell B if spell A is on cooldown, etc.
Advanced spiteful shade logic.
