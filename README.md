# Phatz-Mythic-Plus-Affix-Helper
A simple plugin to help with different mythic plus affixes.

Features:
 Cast spell on explosives (target). IMPLEMENTED
# Cast spell on explosives (mouseover). IMPLEMENTED
# Cast spell on Spiteful Shade. NOT IMPLEMENTED

Lots of code borrowed from Aya's kick plugin, thanks to Aya and Snoogen for keeping their plugins opensource.

I mostly play Paladin at the moment so most spells are untested but please give feedback.

I can add any spell on request, just send me the spellname and the range of the spell.
Works best with ranged, spammable spells with no cooldowns that don't interfere with your damage rotation.
If your spell has a 6second cooldown you can (obviously) only kill explosives every 6 seconds, for example.

Recommend using mouseover to control what explosive to kill and not to interfere with your main damage rotation. I can not guarantee which spell aimsharp will cast if you directly target the explosive. The plugin has logic for casting spell on targeted explosive - but no logic for pausing main rotation, effects uncertain and may vary.


# Possible future ToDo (when/if i learn to code) - NO PROMISES!
# Consider making spell text like in Snoogens queue plugin instead of dropdown.
# Add support for using more than 1 spell on explosives.
# Advanced logic per class instead of working per spell, for example using different spells depending on the range to the explosive for melee classes and use spell B if spell A is on cooldown, etc.
# Advanced spiteful shade logic.
