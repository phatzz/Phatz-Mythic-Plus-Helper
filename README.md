# Phatz-Simple-Explosive-Killer
A simple plugin to kill explosives on mouseover/target.
Lots of code taken from AYA's kick plugin, hence the delay settings.

I mostly play Paladin at the moment so most spells are untested but please give feedback.

I can add any spell on request, just send me the spellname and the range of the spell.
Works best with ranged, spammable spells with no cooldowns that don't interfere with your damage rotation.
Recommend using mouseover only to control what explosive to kill and not to interfere with your main damage rotation. I can not guarantee which spell aimsharp will cast if you directly target the explosive.


Possible future ToDo (not likely to be soon.)
- Add support for using more than 1 spell.
- Add support for stun/slow Spiteful Shade on Spiteful Affix.
